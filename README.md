# Esys-Particle-geomtry-and-some-results
This repository is a simualtion of particle geometry using ESyS-Particle (Open source Python-based numerical software)
This code (cube.py) is a volume filling algorithm that insert seed particle into a prescribed shape (cube in this case). It can be modified to accomodate 3D-scanned rocks or particles. Examples on application on different rock shapes are shon in the .png files
